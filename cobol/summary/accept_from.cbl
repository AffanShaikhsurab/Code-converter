This COBOL program, named "accept-from-example" and last updated on 2022-05-02, demonstrates various forms of the ACCEPT verb. It accepts input from different sources such as command-line arguments, environment variables, date, time, user name, console, screen lines, and screen columns. The program does not depend on any external files, but it uses system variables and system calls. The ACCEPT verb is used to retrieve values from these sources and store them in working storage variables.
