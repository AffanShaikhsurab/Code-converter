The provided COBOL code, named "SAMPLE1", does not depend on any external files. It is a simple program that displays the message "Hello COBOL World!" and then stops running. The program has a working-storage section that contains a single variable, WS-NUMBER1, initialized to the value 123, but this variable is not used in the program.
