The COBOL code provided is a simple program that hides input text using the "secure" keyword in the "accept" statement. The program prompts the user to enter a password, hides the input text as it is being typed, and then displays the entered password. The program only has one procedure, "main-procedure", and uses one working-storage variable, "ws-password", to store the entered password. This program does not depend on any external files.
