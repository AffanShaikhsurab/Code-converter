This COBOL code consists of examples of the ACCEPT statement in COBOL, which is used to get input from the user or environment. The code includes examples of accepting input without any special syntax, accepting secure input which hides the input from being displayed on the screen, and accepting input from various sources such as command line arguments, environment variables, and console input. The code depends on the files accept.cbl, accept-secure.cbl, and accept_from.cbl.
