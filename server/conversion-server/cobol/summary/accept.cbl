The COBOL code provided is a program that demonstrates various forms of the ACCEPT verb. It does not depend on any external files, as it only uses a working-storage variable `ws-input` to store user input.

The program demonstrates the following types of ACCEPT:

1. Basic accept syntax, storing user input in a variable.
2. Accept without storing input, only waiting for user input.
3. Accept with timeout, waiting for user input for a specified duration.
4. Accept with auto-skip, automatically entering user input when the variable's width is reached.
5. Accept with no-echo, not displaying user input as it is entered.
6. Accept with uppercase conversion, converting user input to uppercase.

The program uses the `display` statement to prompt the user for input and to display the entered value. The `at yyxx` clause is used to specify the line and column numbers for screen mode input/output statements, as the program enters screen mode after the first accept statement.
