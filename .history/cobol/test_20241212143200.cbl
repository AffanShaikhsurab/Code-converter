Here is the equivalent Python code for the provided COBOL code:

```python
# Program to add two numbers

# Initialize the numbers and sum
num1 = 0
num2 = 0
sum = 0

# Get user input for the first number
num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))

# Get user input for the second number
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Compute the sum
sum = num1 + num2

# Display the sum
print("The sum of", num1, "and", num2, "is", sum)
```

In this Python code, we define three variables (`num1`, `num2`, and `sum`) and initialize them to 0. We then use the `input()` function to get user input for the two numbers, and convert the input strings to integers using the `int()` function. We compute the sum by adding the two numbers, and then display the result using the `print()` function.
